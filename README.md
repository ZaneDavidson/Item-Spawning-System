# Item-Spawning-System
Unity addressables based item spawning system in C#

This system requires a referenced JSON file to be read with data on items to be spawned. Additionally, classed items must be created so they can be instanced by the spawner system. 

This system runs off the unity addressables package so make sure Unity is version 2018.3 or later.
